# Rational Player Models

Described here are the primary rational player models of Kanban-Zai.
They do not need to be included as a claim in a Kanban-Zai file as they are implied because all other RPM's must 
extend from one of these RPM's

NOTE: rational players in Kanban-Zai are different from those in game theory.


## RATIONAL PLAYERS ( Player One)

To be a rational player in Kanban-Zai you first must understand what game you are playing.

Traditionally a workforce plays the Conflict Game.  In Kanban-Zai you are playing the collaborative Game.


All other RPM's in Kanban-Zai ultimately inherit from this RTM.

* Understands the concept of Kanban-Zai.
* Agrees to muster on as a team-mate or interested party.
* Agrees to abide by the constraints, values and norms set forth in Kanban-Zai or Kanban-Zai extension.
* Agrees to maintain a personal Kanban-Zai file and journal of company, team and individual deviations from Kanban-Zai.
* Agrees to be subordinate to the team, which means agrees to participate in the consensus.
* Agrees that every other member of the team are equal participants.
* Agrees to follow any processes defined by the teams current implementation of Kanban-Zai.
* Agrees to want to be present and interested in the team.
* Agrees to want to improve the team, within the boundaries set by Kanban-Zai.
* Agrees to allow others to improve the team, within the boundaries set by Kanban-Zai.
* Agrees that interested parties are to be prioritised.
* Agrees that external parties are to be managed by interested parties.  No direction can be taken from an external.
* Expects all other players to conform to the relevant Rational Player Models.

## RATIONAL OBSERVERS (Interested Parties)

Primarily an interested party is the client tasked with a project by their employer.  Or they could be the primary 
money source.  Their request must be prioritized with full discussion and transparency.

## IRRATIONAL PLAYERS (External Parties)

Are NON-RATIONAL PLAYERS.  Many times they are the ones paying, this is an obvious problem for the team as one paying 
is usually the one who can make unreasonable demands.  For their sake and the teams their requests must be prioritised
by the relevant interested parties and feedback given as to the impact of the request.  Team members MUST NOT take 
direction from external parties.  Other external parties are of no consequence. 

## GUESTS EXTEND IRRATIONAL PLAYERS

From time to time the team may require specialized knowledge or experience.  In this case an individual maybe invited 
onto the team for a time by a team member only, but without a consensus vote.  Guests have a special status on the team.
They sit as part of the team. They do not have to be mustered, they may not vote, and their appearance on the team and
subsequent departure from the team must be journaled.

Upon arrival the journal must include the length of the guests expected stay.  If that stay is extended the new expected
length of stay must be audited.

Guests:-

* have no voting rights on the team and remain advisors until their tenure ends.
* must be fully transparent with regards their purpose and activities.
* may not participate in any private discussion regarding the team, because that breaks the

## PAN EXTEND RATIONAL PLAYERS (Peter Pan)

Sometimes depending on the situation of the team, by a consensus only, any team member can be designated as "PAN".  

Pan is a temporary designation allowing that individual veto power over a consensus for a defined period.  

This maybe done without running a deviation and with only a quorum. It carries with it a maximum allowed 
time of 1 month.  At which time the team can again choose to re-designate the person as "PAN" again.

Only Team members may be designated as pan.

* Panning must be journaled for every instance.
