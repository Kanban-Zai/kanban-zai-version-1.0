# Rational Outcome Models

ROMs are objective definitions about the final state of some aspect of your process.

# Browser Model ( Team definition required )

    Chrome, firefox, ios, android - latest version.
    
    This model has a big impact on your dev cycle.   It says you must always test against the latest versions of
    these platforms.  This has backward compatability consideration which would not exist if you specified a version
    of each peice of software or even a version range.
    
    This is just a example of a rom. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
    
# Idea
    Can be achieved, 
    is marketable, 
    Has market appitite, 
    can be stated clearly, 
    passes sanity check, 
    has an elevator pitch
    has a clear definition
    is understandable
  
# Code Quality ( Team definition required )

    This is a very subjective term and dependent on the team.  In-fact Kanban-Zai requires a team to define
    a code quality ROM.  To much code quality can lead to Inertia and to little code quality can also lead
    Inertia.  
    
    Inertia = complexity * shortcuts to avoid complexity ^ 2 
    
    _* for clarity "complexity" is not ONLY refering to code complexity.  There is complexity everywhere
    not just in code. For a new person comming onboard everything is complex.  Beware of hidden complexity._
    
    Code quality is a difficult thing to explain, because it is subjective.  Complexity to one maybe simplicity to 
    another but past a certain point complexity is complexity to all, but when you are at this point it is hard to
    resist inertia.  
    
    This scenario has real world parallels.  The famous line  "If I Had More Time, I Would Have Written a Shorter 
    Letter" perfectly explains what complexity and more specifically what code quality is.

# Value Proposition

    Percieved Value = Percieved Value ^ 3
    
    VP's are probably the hardest thing about any project.  From a traditional perspective is looks like this
    
        Value = what the users wants + what you provide - what your competitors provide.
        
    In present times it depends on 3 factors.
    
    Market Fit - This is the domain of the client.  It is all about market appitites.
    Business Fit - This is bout the business rules and ultimatley how the business is going to moneitize the product
    Technology Fit - If the technology is current and can do what is required great.  Keep away from sunrise & sunset 
                    tech as a rule of thumb.  but also don ignore them out of hand.
    
# Cheap, Fast, Reliable. Choose 2.

    Cheap + fast = Lower quality work.  Meaning, the "value proposition" has probably been so de-scoped it barely 
                   resembles what was originally asked for. ( this is a good thing by the way )
                   
    Fast + Reliable = expensive.  Meaning, prone to gold plating, meaning, not fast.  Likely to suffer from market creep
                      because you spent so much time making it perfect.
                      
    Reliable + cheap = If you are cutting and pasting somebody elses already complete reliable code then yes, otherwise
                       no.

    In a huge twist of irony, cheap and fast is probably the best outcome for everybody.  Be Aware, cheap does not equal
    bargin basement, infact it is probably exactly the same rate as reliable, but because the "value proposition" has 
    been simplified much less time will be spent.
    
# Productivity Model ( Required in ALL implementations of Kanban-Zai )

    According to the Sanderson Uncertainty Principle, SUP for short, to measure productivity is to cause unproductivity.
    
    It is a fallacy that it can be measured.  Kanban-Zai only permits the measurement of quality output. 
     
    What is quality output?
    
    In short a client provides a "value proposition".  The measure of quality becomes, once that "value proposition" is 
    delivered is it exactly what was asked for?
    
    The obvious difficulty here is creating a clear VP, it is a very hard problem to solve, mainly because it is an
    unsolveable problem in the context of objectivity. 
    
    One must understand that during the process of development things can change.  Part of the VP may not be required 
    anymore, or some technology blocker might require a rewriting of the value proposition, whatever the cause the fact 
    remains that there are many unpredictabe reasons that value could change.  The client must be kept apprised of any 
    changes and depending on the teams cadence may choose to nullify the effort.

# Estimates

    Estimates are not commitments, why would anybody ever think otherwise?  Commitments are the opposite of estimates.


# Anathema Model ( Required in ALL implementations of Kanban-Zai )

    Be all things to all people in all device on all platforms. This is considered an irrational outcome.  There is a 
    scenario where this model is rational.  When you have a near infinite budget, or at least not something you ever have
    to think about.
