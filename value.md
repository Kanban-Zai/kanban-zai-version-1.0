# Value

Value to customers and ultimately the definition of quality, is a very subjective concept.  It is what your customers 
perceive it to be.  It's so subjective, that it's hard to define it. If you know what customers benchmark as quality 
you can provide it.  

Ultimately the client holds the responsibility of defining what value means to them, but it is the responsibility of 
all team members to help them define it.

This doesn't mean saying yes all the time.  In fact most of the time you should say no.  It is very easy to be 
enthusiastic with ideas, but it is completely another thing to understand what those ideas cost.

# Value Proposition

    Percieved Value = Percieved Value ^ 3
    
    VP's are probably the hardest thing about any project.  From a traditional perspective is looks like this
    
        Value = what the users wants + what you provide - what your competitors provide.
        
    In present times it depends on 3 factors.
    
    Market Fit - This is the domain of the client.  It is all about market appitites.
    Business Fit - This is bout the business rules and ultimatley how the business is going to moneitize the product
    Technology Fit - If the technology is current and can do what is required great.  Keep away from sunrise & sunset 
                    tech as a rule of thumb.  but also don ignore them out of hand.
