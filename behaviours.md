# Behaviours

Behaviors are objective definitions of what are considered rational behaviours in Kanban-Zai. 

So what are Rational Behaviours?

Rational behaviours tell everybody on the team that you are acting in the best interests of the team.  Stepping outside
the boundaries of behaviours tells the opposite story.

Behaviours can be introduced into a Kanban-Zai implementation in two ways, as general references or as team norms.

General references are attatched to rational player models and define what it means to be a ration play in the given 
context  <---- this is a terrible explanation - fix it

Team norms on the other hand define specific behaviours that are acceptable or required in an implementation.
 
## COMMON SENSE AFFIRMATIONS

    The digital development world is very different than the normal everyday world.  Common sense works dangerously 
    different in the digital because to the novice it is hard to tell why a choice that would normally be made is
    catastrophic in the digital.   
    
    Below are listed affirmations.  These are habitual thoughts behaviors that apply to all Kanban-Zai 
    implmentations and define in broad strokes what it means to be a rational player in the digital world.  Just like
    the real there are different common sense contexts and so specific rational player models are left to each
    implementation and are introduced in the claims propety to the relevant Kanban-Zai file.
