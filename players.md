# Rational Player Models

What does a rational player look like?

## THE RATIONAL PLAYER ( Player One )

A Rational player accepts and understands 3 truths:

1. They are now playing the Kanban-Zai game. 
2. They WANT to be playing the game.  
3. They have a SAY in the team.

Rationality should be the NORMAL inside a Kanban-Zai team. However, rationality is not enough: each player must also 
believe that all other players are rational. Even this is not enough: each player must believe that all other players 
believe that all other players are rational.  This is an important belief for rational players to maintain as it is the
first alarm bell.  If a player stops believing this it is because at least one player on the team no longer carrys this 
belief.  The team must understand why.

A rational player accepts and understands the Rational Outcome Models of Kanban-Zai  Rational Outcome Models
form the core belief system in Kanban-Zai.  

More over a rational player adheres to the Rational Behaviours of Kanban-Zai.

## THE IRRATIONAL PLAYER ( Player Three )

These players are NON-RATIONAL.  They do not share the beliefs of Player 1 because they do not understand them, and they
quite likely never will.  To participate in a Kanban-Zai team these players require escorts or must adhere to an RPM
but they may not have a SAY.

WARNING: Team members MUST NOT take direction from Player Three.

## CLIENT EXTENDS PLAYER THREE

Clients have granted to them the special privilege of the ability to order the work queue.
 
## GUEST EXTENDS PLAYER THREE

Serve as special advisors to a team for a defined time. They may not interrogate the team in any fashion, covert or 
overt.  All actions taken by guests are journalable and their arrival and departure must be journaled.

## PAN EXTENDS PLAYER ONE

Via a quorum a rational player can be granted the privilege of pan.  Pan, has veto power over all consensus for a defined 
period of no more than 1 month maximum.  The election must be journaled as must the start and end dates.
