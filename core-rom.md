# Rational Outcome Models

ROMs are constrained boundaries of concepts in kanban-zai.  For example.  The value model defines what must be included
on a card before it can be considered for processing.

Deviations from ROMS is always a journalable action.  This can often happen because an inherited ROM might not fit your
exact situation.  DON'T PANIC.  Create your own ROM.  It is not a requirement to extend from another ROM, just that you
have them.

# product-rom

The product model represents the set of business rules of a product.  Primarily it should define what is not allowed 
in a product model rather than what is allowed.  It should also define how value cards should be derived from the
product model.

# value-rom

This model defines what must be specified before a card can be considered for quality delivery.

# quality-rom

This model defines what is required to deliver quality value


# Anathema Model

Be all things to all people in all device on all platforms. This is considered an irrational outcome.  There is a 
scenario where this model is rational.  When you have a near infinite budget, or at least not something you ever have
to think about.
