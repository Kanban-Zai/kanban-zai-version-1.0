# Rational Outcome Models

ROMs are objective definitions about the final state of some aspect of your process.

# Browser Model Example

    Chrome, firefox, ios, android - latest version.
    
    This model has a big impact on your dev cycle.   It says you must always test against the latest versions of
    these platforms.  This has backward compatability consideration which would not exist if you specified a version
    of each peice of software or even a version range.
    
    This is just a example of a rom. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
    
# Idea
    Can be achieved, 
    is marketable, 
    Has market appitite, 
    can be stated clearly, 
    passes sanity check, 
    has an elevator pitch
    has a clear definition
    is understandable
    
    
# Productivity Model ( Required in ALL implementations of Kanban-Zai )

    According to the Sanderson Uncertainty Principle, SUP for short, to measure productivity is to intrupt productivity.
    
    It is a fallacy that it can be measured.  Kanban-Zai only permits the measurement of quality output.  What is quality
    output?
    
    In short a client provides a "value proposition" the measure of quality is then once that "value proposition" is 
    delivered is it exactly what was asked for.
    
    The obvious difficulty here is creating a clear VP, it is a very hard problem to solve, mainly because it is an
    unsolveable problem in the context of objectivity. 
    
    One must understand that during the process of development things can change.  Part of the VP may not be required 
    anymore, or some technology blocker might require a rewriting of the value proposition, whatever the cause the fact 
    remains that there are many unpredictabe reasons that value could change.  The client must be kept apprised of any 
    changes and depending on the teams cadence may choose to nullify the effort.


# Anathema Model ( Required in ALL implementations of Kanban-Zai )

    Be all things to all people in all device on all platforms. This is considered an irrational outcome.  There is a 
    scenario where this model is rational.  When you have a near infinite budget, or at least not something you ever have
    to think about.
