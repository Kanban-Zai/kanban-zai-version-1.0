# Rational Outcome Models

ROM's are objective definitions about the final state of some aspect of your process.

# Browser Model Example

    Chrome, firefox, ios, android - latest version.
    
    This model has a big impact on your dev cycle.   It says you must always test against the latest versions of
    these platforms.  This has backward compatability consideration which would not exist if you specified a version
    of each peice of software or even a version range.
    
    This is just a example of a rom. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

# Anathema Model ( Required in ALL implementations of Kanban-Zai )

    Be all things to all people in all device on all platforms. This is considered an irrational outcome.  There is a 
    scenario where this model is rational.  When you have a near infinite budget, or at least not something you ever have
    to think about.
