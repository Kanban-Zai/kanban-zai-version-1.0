# Kanban-Zai Methodology.

Kanban-Zai (KBZ) Methodology replaces the Agile and Waterfall Methodologies, in specific situations.

The concept of Kanban-Zai evolved from more than 20 years in the trenches of waterfall and agile.

The rationale behind Kanban-Zai can be reduced to 4 observations.

* Software Development is a creative process.
* People can operate in creative mode or survival mode but not both.
* The best creative work comes when you empower everyone.  
* The most productive teams are teams that empower everyone.

Kanban-Zai looks to level the playing field for everyone.

## IMPLEMENT

To implement Kanban-Zai in your project all you need to do is formally adopt the core by creating your own 
kanban-zai.yaml file in a public code repository of your choice.

## EXTEND

Next specify which core module you are extending from.  

All kbz implementations must extend from the core, ultimately.  This means you can extend from another extension that 
ultimately extends from the core. 

Not specifying an extension implies you are extending from the latest core module, but the preference is an extension 
should be explicitly stated.

From this point you add your own settings, modules and norms to that kanban-zai file and you are running a Kanban-Zai 
team.

Rejoice!

## CONTRIBUTE OR JOIN!

If you have something to add please submit a pull request. If you would like to help curate and guide Kanban-Zai then
 request to join the crew through the github team.

## COMMITMENT

Kanban-Zai core will be continuously improved, however no minor version will ever change the meaning of the major 
version.  If there is a significant deviation in meaning the minor version will then become the next major version.

Any changes to any version of the core will be done conservatively and as a result of robust debate.

## KANBAN-ZAI LICENSE

If you choose to implement Kanban-Zai and wish to say you are running a Kanban-Zai project then you MUST, at a minimum, 
implement the Kanban-Zai core.

You may not modify the Kanban-Zai Core in any way, but you may extend your implementation through the 
approved methodologies described in the Kanban-Zai core.

You may not extend your implementation in any way that nullifies or alters the meaning of any part of the Kanban-Zai core.

Breaching any part of this license revokes your right to publicly declare, any endeavour you undertake, as Kanban-Zai.

This license applies to all legal and illegal entities including but not limited to individual people, companies, 
partnerships, sole traders, dogs called max, Artificial Intelligences, movie producers...I don't know...you name it,

#### PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

It’s mentally tough trying to explain simplicity to people. 
They all want it to be difficult, I think. It isn’t really.
