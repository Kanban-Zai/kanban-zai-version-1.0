# Rational Increment Model

The RIM is a First In First Out ( FIFO ) list of units of work.  Called cards.

* New cards maybe added at any time.
* Each card must contain an Objective Value Proposition.
* The list must be ordered from most important at the top to least important at the bottom at all times.
