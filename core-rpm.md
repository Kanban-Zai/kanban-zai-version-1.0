# Rational Player Models

What does a rational player look like?

## THE RATIONAL PLAYER ( Player One )

A Rational player first and foremost understands they are now playing the Kanban-Zai game.  More importantly they must
WANT to be playing the game.  Rational Players have a SAY in the team.

However, rationality is not enough: each player must also believe that all other players are rational. 
Even this is not enough: each player must believe that all other players believe that all other players are rational.

Rationality should be the NORMAL inside a Kanban-Zai team.

## THE SPECIAL RATIONAL PLAYER ( Player Two )

Players new to Kanban-Zai will likely fit the player 1 model.  On paper.  But their trust in Kanban-Zai will be 
naturally low.  It will not be until they are "a season or two" in that they will actually start internalising the 
situation.

## THE IRRATIONAL PLAYER ( Player Three )

These players are NON-RATIONAL.  They do not share the beliefs of Player 1 because they do not understand them, and they
quite likely never will.  To participate in a Kanban-Zai team these players require escorts or must adhere to an RPM
but they may not have a SAY.

WARNING: Team members MUST NOT take direction from Player Three.

## CLIENT EXTENDS PLAYER THREE

Clients have granted to them the special privilege of the ability to order the work queue.
 
## GUEST EXTENDS PLAYER THREE

Serve as special advisors to a team for a defined time. They may not interrogate the team in any fashion, covert or 
overt.  All actions taken by guests are journalable and their arrival and departure must be journaled.

## PAN EXTENDS PLAYER ONE

Via a quorum a rational player can be granted the privilege of pan.  Pan has veto over all consensus for a defined 
period of no more than 1 month maximum.  The election must be journaled as must the start and end dates.
