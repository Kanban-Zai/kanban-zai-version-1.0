Is there really a shortage of developers? Yes, But The Problem Is More Complicated Than It Looks.

...

a shortage of four million cybersecurity workers...

...

In 2020, an estimated 1 million computer programming-related jobs in the US are expected to be unfilled.

...

The IT industry is rapidly changing, which has led to a shortage of software engineers to help manage workloads, new 
technologies and new ways of working. According to November 2019 insights from CNBC News, there are about 920,000 
unfilled IT positions.

...

The root of the problem is a general shortage of engineers across the tech space. In London alone (2020), there are over
 5,000 software engineer vacancies and over 6,500 for software developers according to Adzuna

...

Evans Data Corporation recently announced the results for their Global Developer Population and Demographic Study, 
which suggests that there are currently 26.9 million developers worldwide. 

_It is also predicted that the global developer population will increase to crushing 45 million by 2030_

...

Reportedly, there are about 300 million people who are trying to start 150 million businesses worldwide. One-third of 
that number are to be launched, and there are about 50 million new businesses each year, which leads to 137,000 startups
 made per day.

...

The latest available entrepreneur statistics worldwide in 2020 reveal that there are now 582 million entrepreneurs in 
the world, with many operating from exotic locations.

...

Worldwide, there are about 472 million entrepreneurs. Statistically, there are about 305 million total startups created
in a year. 1.35 million businesses out of those startups are tech related.

...

Today, software is the driving force of the world – with an estimated 9 trillion devices in use, it is the glue that 
connects people from all around the globe. 

_Software developers are shaping and building the modern technological world._

# Kanban-Zai.

Kanban-Zai (KBZ) is a teleology that replaces the Agile and Waterfall Methodologies, in specific situations.

The concept of Kanban-Zai has evolved from more than 20 years in the trenches of waterfall and agile.

The rationale behind Kanban-Zai can be reduced to 3 observations.

* Software Development is a creative process.
* People can operate optimally in creative mode or survival mode but not both.
* The best creative work comes when you empower everyone.  

## IMPLEMENT

To implement Kanban-Zai in your project all you need to do is formally adopt the core by creating your own 
kanban-zai.yaml file in a public code repository of your choice.

* This file documents the behaviours, claims, constraints and values of a Kanban-Zai.
* It must be held in a public repo.
* All changes to this file must be tracked.
* It must be kept current and reflective of the present.
* May only be modified by rostered team members.

[The Kanban-Zai Core](./core.md)

## EXTEND

Next specify which core module you are extending from.  

All kbz implementations must extend from the core, ultimately.  This means you can extend from another extension that 
ultimately extends from the core. 

Not specifying an extension implies you are extending from the latest core module, but the preference is that an origin 
should be explicitly stated.

From this point you add your own claims, settings, modules and norms to that kanban-zai file and you are running a 
Kanban-Zai team.

Rejoice!

What is an extension?

An extension defines a delivery process.  The method your team is going to use, to get from idea stage to product and 
how it is going to keep doing that or when it is going to stop.  The core itself uses a standard prioritised backlog as
its delivery process, backed by the core ROMS.  It is recommended that you use an extension early on.

What is a module?

Modules a pre-packaged collections of Kanban-Zai concepts and ideas that you might want to include in yout process.

The rules of extension:

* The core must be used by ALL (100%) Kanban-Zai implementations
* Once installed you can extend it with any process you like by following the principles laid out in the core.
* You may add a module to your Kanban-Zai file with the "implements" property.
* The meaning and intent of the core module may not be modified by any extension, module or customisation.
* All properties of an extension or module must be inherited, including other upstreams that they extend from.
* You may not remove any properties of an extension or module.
* You may not modify read only properties of an extension or module.
* You may only change the properties of an extension or module to the values, if specified, of the extension or module.
* If there is a property that does not work for you then do not use that extension or module.  Create your own.
* Your customisations must not contradict any aspect of the Kanban-Zai core or any extension or module you use.

SANITY CHECK:

* You should probably not create your own extension or module unless you have some experience in Kanban-Zai.  
* Additionally, you should not nest your implementation to deeply.
* You should probably just extend from the core in most cases.

If you have something to add please submit a pull request. If you would like to help curate and guide Kanban-Zai then
 request to join the crew through the [github team](https://github.com/Kanban-Zai).

## COMMITMENT

Kanban-Zai core will be continuously improved, however no minor version will ever change the meaning of the major 
version.  If there is a significant deviation in meaning the minor version will then become the next major version.

Any changes to any version of the core will be done conservatively and as a result of robust debate.

## KANBAN-ZAI LICENSE

If you choose to implement Kanban-Zai and wish to say you are running a Kanban-Zai project then you MUST, at a minimum, 
implement the Kanban-Zai core.

You may not modify the Kanban-Zai Core in any way, but you may extend your implementation through the 
approved methodologies described in the Kanban-Zai core.

You may not extend your implementation in any way that nullifies or alters the meaning of any part of the Kanban-Zai core.

Breaching any part of this license revokes your right to publicly declare, any endeavour you undertake, as Kanban-Zai.

This license applies to all legal and illegal entities including but not limited to individual people, companies, 
partnerships, sole traders, dogs called max, Artificial Intelligences, movie producers...I don't know...you name it, 
it applies.

#### PERSONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

It’s mentally tough trying to explain simplicity to people. 
They all want it to be difficult, I think. It isn’t really.
