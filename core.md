#  KANBAN-ZAI CORE - WHAT IS IT?

Kanban-Zai is an interpretation and implementation of, amongst others
* [collaborative game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory)
* [constraint theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints)
* [consensus theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_theory)
* [swift trust theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_trust_theory)  
When you implement Kanban-Zai you are making a conscious choice to VALUE objectivity, predictability, tolerance and trust.

### Beliefs, Behaviours and constraints

Kanban-Zai is a belief system that leverages behaviors and constraints to define a framework in which people can work
objectively and effectively.  It is a way for humans to collaborate and co-opts many different ideas about project
management to build heuristics that help teams be better.  It is important to recognise that it is not dogma. 

NOTE: In constraint theory constraints restrict throughput and should be.  In Kanban-Zai constraints focus attention and
must not be broken.

### The Trust Equation

Managing and designing for trust is crucial to thrive in the digital age.  The trust equation allows the ability 
to think objectively about trust and how it works.

    Trust = ( Vibability + Credibility + Reliability ) / Self Orientation (Selfishness)
    
The trust equation tells us how trust is hard to build and easy to destroy.

### Reputation and the Referral Chain

Kanban-Zai is a graph.  It provides transparency about teams and individuals not possible previously.

# THE RATIONAL TRUST MODEL

### CONTEXT

Context defines which root node to find your collections of settings, method, values, norms and claims on.  The initial 
context is default.  This means these should all be found on the root node.  When context is set to anything other than
default, given that it can also not be one of the reserved words, then you use the settings on the root node named the
same as the current context.

### JOURNAL (Referral Chain)

All deviations from Rational Player Models, Rational Outcome Models or The Rational Trust Model must be journaled in 
the team kanban-zai.yaml file, but ony when explicitly stated by the kanban-zai implementation.

However, anything may be journaled and by anyone in their own personal kanban-zai.yaml files.  

See [core-jml](./core-jml.md) for more.

### BELIEFS

#### RATIONALITY

To be rational in Kanban-Zai is to want to play by the rules.  However, rationality is not enough: each player must also 
believe that all other players are rational. Even this is not enough: each player must believe that all other players 
believe that all other players are rational.

#### IRRATIONALITY

To be irrational in Kanban-Zai is to not share the same belief of rationality because they do not understand them, and
quite likely never will.  Irrational players do not have say in a Kanban-Zai Team.

### COMMONSENSE

Common sense works different in the digital world.  What is obvious and sensibly in the real world may not be in the 
digital.  A poor choice in the digital can have outrageous time and cost penalties when compared to a similar 
circumstance in the real.  Maybe.

### TEAM NORMS

These are behaviours that are regularly encouraged or required of team members.  They can also be behaviours that, 
while not common or generally accepted as normal, are accepted as normal on a team.

#### DEVIATE

A deviation is not a retrospective in the agile sense.

It is a formal method of allowing settings to be changed in Kanban-Zai and must be run regularly with the maximum time 
allowed between deviations being 3 monthly.  Keep it short and involve everybody.  Change by a consensus only. 

#### MUSTER

The roster is a list of all current team members and interested parties.  New members must be added.  
Old members must be removed.  A consensus vote is required to be mustered as a team member.


#### CONSENSUS

Core consensus requires an agreement of a quorum of the mustered team members about the direction the team should be 
taking.  Negative votes, and the reasons for them must be journaled.

#### PAN

Via a quorum a rational player can be granted the privilege of pan.  Pan, has veto power over all consensus for a defined 
period of no more than 1 month maximum.  The election must be journaled as must the start and end dates.

### SETTINGS (constraints)
  
#### egos (READONLY)

Required Value: off

#### quorum

Possible Values: 2 | # > 2  DEFAULT: 2

---

### VALUES

#### objectivity (READONLY)

Objectivity is necessary to get an accurate explanation of how things work.

#### predictability (READONLY)

The fact of always behaving or occurring in the way expected.

#### tolerance (READONLY)

Tolerance is a value orientation towards difference.  Or more simply.  Difference is good.

#### trust (READONLY)

Without trust, there is no future, it is the capital and engine of progress.

### OUTCOMES

#### value

Value to customers and ultimately the definition of quality, is a very subjective concept.  It is what your customers 
perceive it to be.  It's so subjective, that it's hard to define it. If you know what customers benchmark as value 
you can provide it.  

Ultimately the client holds the responsibility of defining what value means to them and it depends on 3 factors
* Market Fit
* Business Fit
* Technology Fit

#### quality

Quality is defined as exact delivery of value asked for.  There is hidden danger in this statement as it seems to say
that value is the responsibility of the delivery team.  It is not.  

Value is what the customer defines, the more accurate the definition the better the value.  A poor definition of value 
must still result in the exact delivery of the value described.

The caveat here is that development is not static.  The delivery team are the people best situated to give early 
feedback about the value proposition as well as cost/benefit ratios and work around's.  Therefore, value can be tweaked
as part of the delivery process.
